### Anki decks

I upload my anki decks here!

### Requirements

- Anki
- Anki addon: CrowdAnki https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki
- (Optional) Anki addon: Markdown and KaTeX Support https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1087328706

### To install decks locally

Set up git folder locally

```git clone https://github.com/juliusedqvist/anki_decks```

- In Anki, go to File>"CrowdAnki: Import from disk" and choose folder.

Pull latest changes with

```git pull origin main```

### Import directly from Anki

- In Anki, go to menu File>"CrowdAnki: Import from GitHub" and enter GitHub username and repository name in suggested format. So, for example, to get my git deck (https://github.com/juliusedqvist/anki_decks/RL) you would need to enter juliusedqvist/RL
